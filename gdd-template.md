# Game Design Document


## Game Name


### Genre


### Game Elements
*game elements are basic activities the player will be doing
for fun*


### Player
*the number of players that can play the game at once*


## Technical Specs

### Technical Form
*basically there are 2D graphics and 3D graphics*



### View
*camera view from which the player will experience the game*


### Platform
*iOS, android, Mac, PC*


### Language
*C#, C++, Rust, gdscript*


### Device
*pc, mobile, console*


### Game Play
*use the game play section to create a sescriptive paragraph about
how the game is played. You want the use for imagine they are actually playing
the game. Try not to use generic (i.e. broad, non-descriptive) terms when
writing about the game paly. For example, few readers want to hear statements
such as, "enemy..1 will have more hit points than enemy..2." Instead, it's
better to make statements like, "The Lazarus Fighter has more armour than the
Apollo Fighter."*




### Game Play Outline

*this outline will vary depending on the type of game.*
- Opening the game application
- Game options
- Story synopsis
- Modes
- Game elements
- Game Levels
- Player's controls
- Winning
- Losing
- End
- Why is all this fun?



### Key Features
*key features are a list of game elements that are attractive
to the player*


## Design Document
*This document describes how GameObjects behave, how they're
controlled and their properties. This is often referred to as the "mechanics" of
the game. This documentation is primarily concerned with the game itself. This
part of the document is meant to be modular, meaning you could have several
different Game Design Documents attached to the Concept Document.*



### Design Guidelines
*This is an important statement about any creative
restrictions that need to be considered and includes brief statements about the
general (i.e. overall) goal of the design.*


### Game Design Definitions
*This section established the definition of the game
play. Definitions should include how a player wins, loses, transitions between
levels, and the main focus of the gameplay.*


### Game Flowchart
*The game flowchart provides a visual of how the different game elements and
their properties interact. Game flowcharts should represent Objects, Properties,
and Actions present in the game. Each of these items should have a number
reference to where they exist within the game mechanics document.*
- Menu
- Synopsis
- Game Play
- Player Control
- Game Over (Winning and losing)


### Player Definition
- Use this section for quich descriptions that define the player
- Use the Player Properties section (below) to define the properties for each
  player. Player Properties can be affected by the player's action or
  interaction with other game elements. Define the properties and how they
  affect the player's current game.
- Use the Player Rewards section to make a list of all objects that affect the
  player in a positive way. Define these objects by describing what affect they
  cause and how the player can use the object.


  ### Player Definitions
  *A suggested list may include*
  - Health
  - Weapons
  - Actions


### Player Properties
*Each property should mention a feeback as a result of the property changing*


### Player Rewards
*Make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way (e.g.
health replenished)*


### User Interface (UI)
*This is where you'll inclide a description of the user's control of the game.
Think about which buttons on a device would be best suited for the game.
Consider what the worst layout is, then ask yourself if your UI is still
playable. A visual representation can be added where you relate the physical
controls to the actions in the game. When designing the UI, it may be valuable
to research quality control and user interace (UI) design information.*
